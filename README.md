#This is my version of the popular Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

Rock, Paper, Scissor is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules.

A brief summary of the rules:

If the two players choose the same “character” it’s a tie, and the game repeats. Rock beats Scissors, Paper beats Rock, Scissors beats Paper.

Used Python's random module to assign a random choice to the cpu so the game is provably fair.
